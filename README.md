For this project, I wanted to create something that is usable for prospective college students applying for college. I remember when I was doing my college search, the sheer number of colleges in the United States was very overwhelming. There are so many different variables at play in the decision-making process, that I wanted to create a filtering tool. 

For my data, I created my own CSV file with ~30 schools around the nation.

The key components for selection consist of:

    1. Region: Area in the United States (Midwest, Northeast, South, West).
    2. Size: Average number of students enrolled in undergraduate programs (Large, Medium, Small).
    3. Setting: The type of area where college is (Urban, Suburban, Rural).
    4. Net Price: The Average cost of attendence at school.

Using this filtering tool, students will answer questions regarding these four key components and the machine will automatically filter out the top 5 schools that match their criteria.
